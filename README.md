# Plan for Learning

This repository is dedicated to tracking and documenting my daily learning and training activities, with a focus on Swedish language study and physical training.

## Purpose
- **Daily Tracking:** Record your progress every day.
- **Swedish Learning:** Document what you learn in Swedish each day.
- **Training:** Log your daily training or exercise activities.

## Data Structure
You can use a table (for example, in a CSV or Markdown file) with the following columns:

| Date       | Swedish Learning                | Training Activity         |
|------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 2025-12-08 | 10:06 until 12 youtube  | Example: Ran 5km         |
| 2025-12-08 | Example: Learned 10 new words   | Example: Ran 5km         |
| ...        | ...                             | ...                      |

- **Date:** The day of the entry.
- **Swedish Learning:** Notes on what you studied or practiced in Swedish.
- **Training Activity:** Details of your physical training or exercise.

## How to Use
1. Each day, add a new row to your data table.
2. Be consistent to see your progress over time.
3. Optionally, you can add more columns if you want to track additional activities.

## Example Entry
| Date       | Swedish Learning         | Training Activity   |
|------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| 2025-12-08 | Watched a Swedish movie | 30 min yoga         |
